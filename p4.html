programming language applications
A programming language is a specially written code used for writing applications. C++ and Java are examples of programming languages. These are known as high level languages because they have been developed to be like a human language.

High level languages are much easier to use than a low level language such as machine code, or assembly language. The advantage of a low level language is that it runs very fast on the computer.
Specific - software written for a defined purpose. Accountancy software is a good example of this that can be bought by anyone.
